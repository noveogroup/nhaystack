Features and goals

TODO

Why not just add stuff to upstream (Haystack or Elasticstack)?
--------------------------------------------------------------

This project aims to solve problems and reuse code patterns between Noveo Group
projects. Parts of this work, once finalized, tested and proven, may become
suitable to be pushed to upstream.
